//! A document's decoded bitmaps, shared by every walker of it
//! (XARA-T-0281).
//!
//! A [`SceneWalker`](crate::SceneWalker) registers each bitmap once, but
//! export, thumbnails and [`build_scene`](crate::build_scene) each make a
//! fresh walker, and each used to decode every bitmap of the document
//! again. A [`Session`](crate::Session) owns one [`DecodedImages`] and
//! hands it to every walker it makes; a walker given one looks a bitmap up
//! there before decoding it and files what it decodes.
//!
//! # The key is the resource's identity, not its content
//!
//! An entry is found by the addresses of the resource's `Arc`s — its
//! pixel data and its encoded original — plus its declared size and the
//! [`PixelBudget`] the image is registered under. The entry keeps clones
//! of those `Arc`s, so an address cannot be reused by another resource
//! while the entry lives. The document's resources are copy-on-write:
//! a bitmap whose bytes change gets new `Arc`s, so it misses and is
//! decoded afresh. Two resources with equal bytes but separate `Arc`s are
//! decoded twice, which only costs time.
//!
//! This is why the damage rule still holds. `scene_damage` compares the
//! images two scenes point to by [`ImageRef`] equality, which is pointer
//! equality of the shared store or else equal pixels — never this cache.
//! A hit hands out the very `ImageRef` an earlier walk registered, which
//! is equal to itself; a changed resource misses, gets a new `ImageRef`
//! with its own pixels, and compares by content.
//!
//! # Who files here
//!
//! Every walker given the cache, and the bitmap gallery's thumbnail
//! thread (`DecodedImages::image_for`), which decodes through the same
//! path and under the process-wide budget the session's walkers use. So a
//! bitmap is decoded once whichever of the two sees it first; two that
//! miss at the same moment both decode, and the first filed wins.
//!
//! # Lifetime
//!
//! Entries whose resource is no longer in the document are dropped the
//! next time a walker of it registers images, so a deleted bitmap's
//! pixels go with the last scene that used them. The decoded levels stay
//! under the pixel budget like any other image.
//!
//! # Photo-adjusted images
//!
//! A bitmap object with photo operations (`xarast_doc::photo`) shows a
//! **derived** image: the master put through the chain. Those are filed
//! here too, keyed by the master's key plus the hash of the evaluable
//! chain ([`xarast_doc::PhotoOps::hash`]), so that export and thumbnail
//! walkers evaluate a chain the view already evaluated no more than they
//! decode. A derived entry goes when its master does, and when no object
//! attached to the document uses its chain any more
//! (`DecodedImages::retain_derived`, which the walker calls when the
//! document changes): an undo that brings a chain back evaluates it
//! again.
