//! The editing commands tools emit: the phase-7 `Command` enum.
//!
//! A tool never mutates the document (architecture §4). It builds an
//! [`EditCommand`] and hands it to a [`CommandSink`]; the session
//! dispatches it through the document's
//! [`CommandBus`](xarast_doc::CommandBus), which runs it inside a
//! [`Tx`] that records every inverse *before* the action applies. Undo is
//! therefore complete by construction, whatever the command does.
//!
//! The enum is called `EditCommand` rather than the phase document's
//! `Command` because `xarast_doc::Command` is the trait every command —
//! these and the layer commands of [`crate::commands`] — implements, and
//! the two names in one scope would be a trap.
//!
//! # Coalescing
//!
//! Coalescing is per command kind (`research/02 §10.13`): two commands
//! merge into one undo step only when [`EditCommand::coalesces_with`]
//! says so *and* they were dispatched inside the same gesture
//! ([`xarast_doc::CommandBus::begin_gesture`]). The label is part of the
//! merge key, so a wrong merge shows up as a wrong "Undo …" label.
//!
//! # Locked layers
//!
//! The document refuses to edit a node carrying the `LOCKED` flag; a
//! locked *layer* protects everything on it, and that is checked here,
//! by every command, before anything is applied ([`on_locked_layer`]).
