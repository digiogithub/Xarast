//! The render-thread protocol (`phase-05 §U5.5`, thread topology `§U2.7`).
//!
//! The document lives on the main thread and never leaves it
//! (architecture §5). What crosses to the render thread is a
//! [`FrameJob`]: an immutable [`DisplayList`] behind an `Arc`, the
//! [`Resolver`] snapshot its paints refer to, and the [`ViewParams`] it was
//! built for. Never a node, never the arena.
//!
//! # One channel, latest wins
//!
//! There is exactly one channel type between the two threads, and it is
//! not a queue. A queue is the wrong shape for frames: a fast pan produces
//! requests faster than a large document rasterises, a queue turns that
//! into a backlog, and the window goes soft — every frame on screen is a
//! frame the user has already scrolled past. The phase document asks for
//! the opposite, and so this is a **mailbox with one slot in each
//! direction**:
//!
//! * a submitted frame *replaces* any frame still waiting, which is
//!   counted as [`RenderStats::superseded`];
//! * a finished frame *replaces* any finished frame the main thread has not
//!   collected yet, counted as [`RenderStats::dropped`].
//!
//! That is the backpressure: at most one frame waits and one is in flight,
//! whatever the input rate, and [`RenderThread::submit`] never blocks.
//!
//! # Generations
//!
//! Every frame carries a generation, allocated by [`RenderThread::submit`]
//! from a counter the main thread owns, strictly increasing. They make the
//! two cancellation rules expressible:
//!
//! * [`RenderRequest::Cancel`] `{ up_to_generation }` drops the waiting
//!   frame if it is that old, and makes the worker throw away an in-flight
//!   result that old instead of publishing it — the document it showed was
//!   closed, or replaced;
//! * a result is never published over a newer one, so the main thread
//!   cannot present frames out of order.
//!
//! A `Final` frame is rasterised in [`FINAL_COLUMNS`] full-height columns,
//! and the worker checks between columns whether it has been cancelled or
//! superseded; if so it abandons the frame ([`RenderStats::aborted`]).
//! That bounds how long new input waits behind an upgrade to one column. A `Draft` frame is not abandoned for a
//! newer one, or a continuous gesture could starve the screen; it is
//! cheap anyway, because it reuses pixels.
//!
//! # Pixel reuse
//!
//! The worker keeps the last frame it published and draws the next one
//! from it where it can — a pan scrolls it and rasterises only the exposed
//! strips, a `Draft` zoom resamples it, and an edit at the same view
//! compares the new scene with the kept frame's and rasterises only the
//! rectangles whose pixels may differ ([`FrameReuse::Repainted`]). That is
//! why a [`FrameJob`] carries the scene rather than a display list: which
//! list to build depends on what the worker holds. The policy is in
//! `reuse.rs`.
//!
//! # Evicted bitmaps: draw what is resident, repaint when the rest is back
//!
//! The production renderer samples images with
//! [`MissingLevels::Substitute`]: a level the pixel budget evicted that
//! needs its base back (a spill read or a decode) is drawn from the best
//! resident level instead, and the render thread never waits for disk or
//! a decoder (XARA-T-0281). After a frame, the worker asks the frame's
//! images which were substituted during it
//! ([`ImageRef::substituted_since`](xarast_render::ImageRef::substituted_since)),
//! hands them to a helper thread that brings their bases back, and adds
//! their damage ([`xarast_render::image_damage`]) to the kept frame's
//! inexact rectangle, so the frame is published as not exact. When the
//! helper is done and no newer frame waits, a `Final` frame is repaired:
//! the worker re-runs its job under a generation of its own, which the
//! reuse policy turns into a [`FrameReuse::Repainted`] frame of exactly
//! that damage — the ordinary repaint path, tiles included. The repair
//! samples with [`MissingLevels::Materialise`], so it is exact even when
//! the budget evicted a base again in between; that is the only place the
//! render thread may still read a base, and only under a budget smaller
//! than one frame's images. A `Draft` frame is not repaired (its `Final`
//! follows anyway), but its bases are brought back all the same.
//!
//! # Waking the main thread
//!
//! The worker calls a waker after publishing. The shell passes one that
//! posts to its event loop; the application core never learns what an
//! event loop is.
