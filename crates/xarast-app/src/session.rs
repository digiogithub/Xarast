//! One open document, and everything the application knows about it.
//!
//! A [`Session`] owns the document, its session state, its view, its undo
//! history, its scene and its dirty tracking. It is the unit the UI shows
//! in a tab and the unit the headless renderer takes. It is `Send`, so it
//! can be moved to a worker thread — but it is never *shared*: the
//! document lives on one thread and the render thread gets an immutable
//! display list, never the arena (architecture §5).
//!
//! # The Phase 6 seam
//!
//! Opening and saving go through [`FileKind`]. `.xar` import and `.xarast`
//! open (`xarast_format::open_reader`) and save are wired. A save is a
//! [`SaveJob`](crate::save::SaveJob) made here from a snapshot and run
//! anywhere ([`Session::save_job`]); [`Session::save_as`] is the same thing
//! run inline. Writing `.xar` is a permanent non-goal (architecture §3.5).
//!
//! # Modified or not
//!
//! The session records the undo history's state serial at its last save
//! (`xarast_doc::History::state_serial`); it is unmodified exactly when the
//! history is back at that state, so undoing every edit since a save clears
//! the title's marker again and redoing one sets it.
