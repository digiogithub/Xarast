//! The arena→[`Scene`] walker.
//!
//! This is the seam the architecture puts in this crate on purpose
//! (`10-architecture.md` §2): `xarast-render` must never depend on
//! `xarast-doc`, so the one component that knows about both lives here.
//! Everything below it — the display list, the tiler, the backends — is
//! testable from hand-built scenes with no document present, and that is
//! what the separation buys.
//!
//! # What the walk guarantees
//!
//! 1. **It never mutates the document.** It takes `&Document` and nothing
//!    else. Bounds are read from the cache where it is warm and computed
//!    on the stack where it is not; the cache is never filled here,
//!    because filling it would make rendering an edit.
//! 2. **Paint order is tree order.** The walk is `Tree::walk_render`, and
//!    the scene's op list is in the order the original paints.
//! 3. **The attribute stack is pushed and popped exactly once per
//!    scope.** `EnterScope` pushes, `LeaveScope` pops, an attribute node
//!    pushes a value into the current scope — which is the protocol
//!    `xarast_doc::walk` documents.
//! 4. **An ink node is painted at `LeaveScope` when it has children and
//!    at `Visit` when it has none.** A `.xar` path stores its fill as its
//!    own child, and a parent paints after its children, so the child
//!    scope must still be in force when the parent's ink is emitted. The
//!    walk emits scope events only for nodes that have children, so the
//!    two cases never overlap.
//! 5. **It is output-deterministic.** The same document, edit state and
//!    viewport produce a byte-identical scene, which is what the corpus
//!    stability test asserts.
//!
//! # Culling
//!
//! A dirty rectangle in device space is mapped back into document space
//! and every subtree whose bounding box misses it is pruned with
//! `Descend::Skip`. Pruning a *subtree* is safe even though attributes
//! scope across siblings: an attribute node has no bounding box and is
//! never pruned, and a pruned node's own attribute children only ever
//! applied to that node.
