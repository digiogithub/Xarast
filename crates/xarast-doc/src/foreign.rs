//! Foreign baggage: per-node data this version does not understand.
//!
//! `research/06 §8` requires that a reader keeps, **on each node**, every
//! piece of data it could not interpret, and that the writer puts it back in
//! place. That is what [`ForeignBaggage`] holds:
//!
//! 1. unknown attributes — from a foreign namespace, from a newer `xarast:`
//!    vocabulary, or unknown standard SVG ones — as `(uri, local, value)`;
//! 2. unknown child elements, comments and processing instructions, as the
//!    **verbatim** text that was read, with their position among the known
//!    children;
//! 3. the three marks of §8.5: `foreign-dirty`, `foreign-stale` and
//!    `base-authoritative`.
//!
//! # Where it lives
//!
//! Not in [`NodeData`](crate::NodeData): that struct is gated at 64 bytes and
//! nearly every node has no baggage. It is a side table on
//! [`Tree`](crate::Tree), keyed by [`NodeId`](crate::NodeId), exactly like
//! the bounds cache. Because the key is the arena slot:
//!
//! - a node keeps its baggage when it is moved, regrouped or put on another
//!   layer — those are relinks, the id does not change;
//! - a deleted node keeps it too, while the history retains the node, so
//!   undoing the deletion brings it back;
//! - destroying a node (history eviction, builder sweep) drops it.
//!
//! Changing baggage is an undoable [`Action::SetForeign`](crate::Action).
//!
//! # Fragments are text, never trees
//!
//! A fragment is kept as the exact bytes that were read (§8.2 item 2): the
//! writer re-emits it raw, never re-serialised, so quoting, escaping and
//! prefixes survive and the preservation digest of §8.4 is stable.
