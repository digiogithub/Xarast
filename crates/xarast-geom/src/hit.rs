//! Precise hit testing: does a pick disc touch what a path paints?
//!
//! # The question every function here answers
//!
//! A pick is a point and a **radius** in document millipoints — the device
//! pick tolerance converted at the current zoom, so it is "device
//! independent" from the caller's point of view. A painted region (a fill,
//! or a stroke outline) is hit when the closed disc of that radius around
//! the point meets the region. With a radius of zero that is plain
//! point-in-region.
//!
//! Everything is computed in **document space, in `f64`**. An object's
//! matrix is applied to its control points exactly (an affine map takes a
//! Bézier to a Bézier), and only then is anything flattened or measured, so
//! a non-uniform scale turns a circular pick disc into neither an ellipse
//! nor an error: the pick stays circular on screen, as it must.
//!
//! # How the disc test works
//!
//! 1. The path is cut down to the segments that can matter: those whose
//!    control-point box reaches a horizontal band around the pick and
//!    extends to its right. Winding is counted along a ray towards +x, so a
//!    segment outside that band contributes nothing to any probe near the
//!    pick, whatever its shape. Only those segments are flattened.
//! 2. If the pick point itself is covered under the fill rule, it is a hit.
//! 3. Otherwise the region, if the disc meets it at all, has boundary inside
//!    the disc, and that boundary lies on flattened edges. Each edge within
//!    the radius is clipped to the disc and split wherever another nearby
//!    edge crosses or overlaps it; coverage is constant on each side of each
//!    piece, so one probe a hair's breadth either side of each piece's
//!    midpoint decides it. This is what makes the answer right for every
//!    fill rule — an edge between winding −1 and 0 is not a boundary under
//!    [`FillRule::Positive`], and coincident edges that cancel are not a
//!    boundary under any rule.
//!
//! The probe offset is [`PROBE`] millipoints, so a hit's witness point is
//! within `radius + PROBE` of the pick; flattening adds at most the
//! flattening tolerance, `max(radius / 8, 0.25)` mp. Both are far below
//! anything a pointer can resolve.
//!
//! # Strokes
//!
//! A stroke is hit when the disc meets its **outline**, built by the same
//! stroker [`stroke_to_path`](crate::stroke_to_path) uses, so caps, joins,
//! mitre limits and dashes are exactly what is drawn; dash gaps do not hit.
//! Stroking a whole 10 000-segment path per pointer move would be far too
//! slow, so only the runs of segments whose stroke can reach the pick are
//! stroked. That is exact, not an approximation: a run boundary sits on a
//! vertex shared with a segment that is too far away to matter, and the
//! spurious cap stroking it would draw there is no bigger than that
//! segment's own stroke.
//!
//! A stroke thinner on screen than [`HitTolerance::min_stroke_width`] —
//! a hairline, whose width is zero, above all — is picked as a band of that
//! width around the (dashed) centreline instead, so a one-pixel line is
//! as easy to click as the tolerance promises.
