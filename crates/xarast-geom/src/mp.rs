//! The millipoint scalar and its overflow contract.
//!
//! A millipoint is 1/1000 of a PostScript point, the unit the `.xar` format
//! stores every coordinate in. An `i32` of them spans +-2 147 483 mp
//! (+-757 m) at a resolution of 0.35 um, which is more range and more
//! precision than any real document needs — but a *corrupt* file can still ask
//! for arithmetic that leaves the range, and what happens then is a
//! correctness question, not a detail.
//!
//! # The overflow contract
//!
//! Three properties are in tension. We must never panic, because a parser that
//! panics on hostile input is a denial of service. We must never wrap, because
//! a wrapped coordinate produces mirrored geometry that looks *plausible* and
//! so escapes review. And we must not force every expression in the flattening
//! and hit-test inner loops to return [`Option`].
//!
//! The resolution:
//!
//! 1. [`Add`](core::ops::Add), [`Sub`](core::ops::Sub), [`Neg`](core::ops::Neg)
//!    and their assigning forms **saturate**, identically in debug and release.
//!    Saturation is total, deterministic and order-preserving, so a value that
//!    leaves the plane lands on its edge rather than on the far side of it.
//!    [`Mp::MIN`] is `i32::MIN + 1` so that negation is total.
//! 2. `Mul<Mp> for Mp` is **not implemented**: millipoints times millipoints is
//!    an area, not a length. Scaling goes through [`Mp::scale`] or
//!    [`Mp::mul_ratio`]; `Div<Mp> for Mp` yields a dimensionless [`f64`].
//! 3. The `checked_*` family returns [`Option`] and is what every I/O boundary
//!    uses, so that a `.xar` record that cannot be represented becomes a
//!    diagnostic rather than a silently clamped point.
//! 4. Inside the **document extent** of `+-(2^30 - 1)` mp, addition and
//!    subtraction of any two values are exactly representable and therefore
//!    provably never saturate. Bounding-box unions, midpoints, deltas and
//!    stroke inflation all live inside that guarantee, which is what lets the
//!    rest of the codebase stop thinking about overflow.
//! 5. [`Mp::sum`] accumulates in `i64` and saturates once, at the end, so a
//!    long polyline's running total cannot saturate mid-way and then recover
//!    into a wrong answer.
//! 6. There is no `From<f32>` and no `to_f32`. `f32` has a 24-bit significand
//!    and loses millipoint precision above 16 777 216 mp, which is hundreds of
//!    points of error in a large document. [`Mp::to_f64`] is exact.
//!
//! The alternatives were rejected deliberately: wrapping produces geometry that
//! is wrong but believable, panicking turns a corrupt file into a crash, and
//! `Option` everywhere costs readability for a case that provably cannot occur
//! inside the extent.
