//! The GPU backend, behind the `gpu` feature.
//!
//! # Status, stated plainly
//!
//! This backend is **structural, not yet validated**. The W0 spike could
//! not measure gate G2 at all: the container it ran in has no
//! `/dev/dri`, no Vulkan ICD and no software rasteriser, so `wgpu`
//! enumerates zero adapters. The phase's own decision rule for that case
//! is to ship CPU-only for Phase 4 and put the GPU backend behind a
//! feature flag, which is what this is.
//!
//! What is here and is real: the device and queue are **supplied by the
//! caller** and never created here (Phase 5 owns adapter selection); the
//! render target format is asserted to be `Rgba8Unorm`; and the twelve
//! blend tables are uploaded as one `256 × 256` `R8Unorm` array, in the
//! layout the compositing shader will sample.
//!
//! What is deferred, and why: the WGSL compositing pass that evaluates
//! paints and dispatches the twelve families on the GPU (tasks R5.3 and
//! R5.4) is not written here. Shipping a shader that has never executed
//! would be worse than shipping none: it cannot be tested on this machine,
//! and the parity test that would catch its mistakes is the one test that
//! cannot run either. Until an adapter exists, this backend reads the
//! coverage back and composites it with [`crate::blend`], the same code
//! the CPU backend uses, so that the two agree by construction rather than
//! by luck. `vello` is therefore **not** a dependency of this backend yet:
//! it is the intended coverage rasteriser for task R5.1, and adding it
//! before the shader that would use it exists would put three megabytes in
//! the binary for nothing.
//!
//! # The format is not a detail
//!
//! The target must be `Rgba8Unorm` and never `Rgba8UnormSrgb`. Every blend
//! family is a table defined on encoded sRGB (`research/03 §2.10`); an
//! sRGB-converting target makes the hardware linearise behind our back and
//! silently changes every one of them. [`GpuBackend::check_target`]
//! refuses the wrong format rather than producing plausible wrong colours.
