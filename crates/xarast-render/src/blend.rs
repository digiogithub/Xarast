//! Xara's twelve transparency families.
//!
//! # One machine, twelve tunings
//!
//! Every family is the same shape (`research/03 §2.7.2`): a scalar *level*
//! is derived from the source colour and the transparency value, and that
//! level selects a tone curve which is applied to the destination. That maps
//! onto one `256 × 256` table per family — [`BlendLut`] — which the CPU
//! compositor indexes and the GPU uploads as a layer of an `R8Unorm` texture
//! array. Twelve of them cost 768 KiB resident.
//!
//! Three families break the pattern and are computed analytically in both
//! backends, because they read the *destination*: **Saturation** and
//! **Luminosity** need the destination's luminance, and **Hue** needs
//! RGB↔HSV.
//!
//! # The convention that catches everyone
//!
//! Xara's transparency is **0 = opaque, 255 = fully transparent**, the
//! inverse of ordinary alpha. Getting it backwards produces output that
//! looks plausible and is wrong.
//!
//! # What is verified and what is not
//!
//! Mix, Stained Glass, Bleach, Darken, Lighten and Brightness are
//! transcribed from the formulas the research document recovered
//! instruction by instruction, and they are exact. Contrast and Bevel depend
//! on static tables inside `libCDraw.a` (`aContrastTable`, the bevel pair)
//! that no header describes; the curves here are documented approximations
//! with the right endpoints and the right direction. Saturation and
//! Luminosity reconstruct `aSaturationTable1/2` and `Recip`/`Off` from the
//! semantics the disassembly shows rather than from their contents. Closing
//! that gap is task R4.5 of the phase: a harness that calls
//! `GDraw::CalcTransparencyX` in the original binary and diffs the tables.
//! Until it runs, `docs/memory/render.md` records these four as unverified.
