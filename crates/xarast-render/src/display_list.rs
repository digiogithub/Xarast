//! The immutable, per-frame display list: what crosses to the render thread.
//!
//! The scene is retained and mutable; the display list is neither. It is a
//! flat, ordered stream of [`DrawCmd`] with every transform already resolved
//! into device space, every paint mapping already moved with its shape, and
//! every command's device bounding box already computed, so that the tile
//! planner never has to touch a path again.
//!
//! # Ordering is a correctness property, not a performance one
//!
//! Xara's exotic blends read the destination (`research/03 §3.4`), so they
//! cannot use fixed blend state and cannot be reordered. A command whose
//! family reads the destination is a **barrier** inside its tile: everything
//! before it is resolved, then the ping-pong swap happens. Getting this
//! wrong produces output that is nearly right, which is the worst kind of
//! bug; the GPU-versus-CPU parity test is the detector.
