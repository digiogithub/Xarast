//! The Xarast render engine.
//!
//! This crate turns a scene into pixels. It is **our** engine: the scene,
//! the display list, the tiler, the paints, the blend families and the
//! compositor are all here. A third-party rasteriser is used for one job
//! only — producing antialiased coverage — because that is the expensive
//! part to write well and the only part no Xara-specific behaviour hides
//! in. Everything above it is ours, which is what makes Xara's conical and
//! diamond gradients, its perspective mapping and its twelve transparency
//! families possible at all.
//!
//! # The shape of a frame
//!
//! ```text
//!  Scene (retained)  ->  DisplayList (immutable, per frame)  ->  bands/tiles
//!        ^                                                            |
//!        |                                                            v
//!   xarast-app's walker                              CpuBackend  |  GpuBackend
//! ```
//!
//! * [`Scene`] is retained and is built by a walker that lives in
//!   `xarast-app`, not here: this crate has no dependency on `xarast-doc`
//!   and never sees a node. That is what lets every test below build its
//!   input by hand with no document present.
//! * [`DisplayList`] is immutable, ordered and thread-safe, with every
//!   transform already resolved into device space.
//! * [`CpuBackend`] is the **deterministic** path. Export and every golden
//!   image go through it, and comparing it with the GPU pixel by pixel is
//!   itself a test.
//!
//! # Four invariants
//!
//! 1. **Never put absolute millipoints in an `f32`.** A 5 m document is
//!    3.6 × 10⁸ mp; `f32` loses 0.04 pt of it, which is visible when zoomed.
//!    Every `f64 → f32` conversion happens relative to a tile origin; see
//!    [`precision`].
//! 2. **Never composite in linear light.** Every blend family is a
//!    256-entry table defined on encoded sRGB (`research/03 §2.10`).
//!    Surfaces are `Rgba8Unorm`-equivalent and a GPU target must never be
//!    `Rgba8UnormSrgb`.
//! 3. **The CPU backend is the oracle and stays byte-reproducible.** Its
//!    SIMD level is pinned, and parallel bands merge by index.
//! 4. **There is exactly one blend-LUT generator**, [`build_blend_lut`],
//!    shared by both backends. Two would drift.
//!
//! # Rounding
//!
//! Device conversion rounds **half away from zero**, with no half-pixel
//! compensation. The original truncates and the application adds half a
//! pixel; we do neither, which is a deliberate one-pixel difference that
//! the golden-image methodology has to know about. See
//! [`precision::round_device`].
//!
//! See `docs/phases/phase-04-render-engine.md` for the specification and
//! `docs/memory/render.md` for the decisions, including the W0 rasteriser
//! spike that chose `vello_cpu`.
