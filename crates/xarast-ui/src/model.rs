//! The view model: what the interface reads, and what it asks for.
//!
//! Every frame the application hands the interface a [`UiModel`] and an
//! empty [`CommandSink`]. Panels read the first and push [`UiCommand`]s into
//! the second; nothing else crosses the boundary. Three consequences follow,
//! and all three are the reason the design is shaped this way:
//!
//! 1. The interface has no state that can disagree with the document, which
//!    is the whole argument for immediate mode (`research/05 §2.3`).
//! 2. Every panel is testable with no window: build a model, run the panel,
//!    assert on the commands.
//! 3. `xarast-app`'s public API can be written independently of this crate;
//!    the adapter that fills a `UiModel` is the only thing that has to know
//!    both sides.
