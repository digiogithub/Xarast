//! Recoverable findings.
//!
//! # Why a diagnostic carries no free text
//!
//! `xar-dump --stats` output is committed as a snapshot, and the corpus files
//! it describes are Xara's artwork, which this repository may not
//! redistribute (`docs/11-licensing-and-clean-room.md §3.2`). A diagnostic
//! that could interpolate a colour name or a text run into its message would
//! be one `--stats` run away from leaking file content into git.
//!
//! So a [`Diagnostic`] is a code, a severity, a record number, a tag and one
//! `u64` of numeric detail. Every field is a fact about the file rather than
//! anything taken out of it, which makes the clean-room rule structural
//! instead of a review item.
//!
//! # Where each of the three types lives, now that `xarast-doc` exists
//!
//! * [`Severity`] is **`xarast-doc`'s**, re-exported. One three-valued enum
//!   serves every importer and the model alike.
//! * [`DiagCode`] stays here. Its members name conditions of this wire
//!   format — a CRC, a deflate block, a nine-byte path stride — that would be
//!   noise in a crate which also serves SVG and `.xarast`.
//!   [`DiagCode::shared`] projects it onto [`xarast_doc::DiagCode`], the
//!   shared vocabulary Phase 2 defined.
//! * [`Diagnostic`] stays here too, and deliberately stays `Copy` and
//!   text-free. [`xarast_doc::Diagnostic`] carries a `String` message, which
//!   is right for a model that has to explain a repair to a user and wrong
//!   for a value a committed snapshot is generated from. `From<Diagnostic>`
//!   converts at the boundary, building the message out of constants and
//!   numbers.
