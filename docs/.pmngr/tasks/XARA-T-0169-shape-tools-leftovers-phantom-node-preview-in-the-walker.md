## Description
- Creation preview is an overlay outline; a filled live preview needs `Preview::phantom` support in `walker.rs` (owned by another agent this round).
- Constrain+Adjust while drawing is "square from centre" here; the original switches to a radius mode that rotates the shape (`research/04 §4.10`).
- T5.5 Convert to shapes (Ctrl+Shift+S).
- Observe in the VM: corner radius under a non-uniform scale (today the ratio to the major axis is kept), the original's Angle field content, default of "scale lines".
- Generate paths for quick shapes with no cached path (`shapes_pending`, walker side).
