## Description
Leftover of US-0034: arrow-key nudges of selected path points (depends on the W4 nudge family, T4.10), Tab/Shift+Tab and Home/End point cycling (research/04 §4.11). SetPath with PathEdit::Move already coalesces per path for nudge runs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The 24 nudge variants move selected points; a run of nudges is one undo step.
