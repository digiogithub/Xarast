## Description
`ToolCtx::snap_point` is applied to move, scale, rotation centre and rectangle/ellipse creation. The path tools (node_edit, pen, freehand start) and guide drags from the rulers do not snap yet (T8.7, acceptance 12 "node editing"). Guide properties dialog and a Delete all guides menu item (`GuideOp::DeleteAll` exists) are missing (T8.6).

## Acceptance Criteria
Mid-drag NumPad . snaps a node drag; guide drag snaps to grid; menu items present.
