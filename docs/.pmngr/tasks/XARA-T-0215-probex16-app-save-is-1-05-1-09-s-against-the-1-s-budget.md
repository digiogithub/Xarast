## Description
`cargo run --release -p xarast-app --example save_probe -- ProbeX16.xar /dev/shm/x` (tmpfs): UI thread 54 ms (snapshot); save thread 1.09 s with thumbnail / 1.05 s without = restore 126 ms + `xarast_format::save` 856 ms (serialise 507, package 327). The format alone is under budget; the app adds the snapshot→Document restore.

## Acceptance Criteria
- ProbeX16 File › Save ≤ 1 s wall on the save thread (tmpfs), UI-thread cost unchanged or lower.

## Notes
Options: serialise straight from `Snapshot` (the SVG writer only reads), or overlap restore with something; measure on tmpfs — the dev machine's 99 %-full md RAID adds 0.5–7 s of fsync.
