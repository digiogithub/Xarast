## Description
Split out of XARA-T-0087: autosave snapshots and recovery are done (xarast-app `autosave`), the append-only journal is not. It needs a serialisable form of every document command (xarast-doc), fsync batching ≤ 250 ms, truncation on autosave and seq-continuity-checked replay on recovery.
