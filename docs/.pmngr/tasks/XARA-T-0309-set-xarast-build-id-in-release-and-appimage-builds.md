## Description
Crash reports name the build as `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` plus `option_env!("XARAST_BUILD_ID")` (`xarast_app::crash::build_id`). Nothing sets `XARAST_BUILD_ID` yet, so every report of a given version looks the same.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The release workflow and the AppImage build export `XARAST_BUILD_ID` (the commit, short hash) when compiling `xarast`.
- The reproducible-build job still produces identical bytes (the id must not include a timestamp).
- `xarast --version --verbose` prints it too.

## Notes
Filed from XARA-US-0064 (F1).
