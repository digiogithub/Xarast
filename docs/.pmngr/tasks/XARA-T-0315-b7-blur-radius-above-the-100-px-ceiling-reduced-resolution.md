## Description
`xarast_render::blur` clamps every radius to `MAX_RADIUS_PX` (100 px, the original's `MAX_SHADOW_BLUR`). The original does not simply clamp a feather: above a 200 px diameter it renders the silhouette at a reduced resolution and scales the mask back up, so a large feather at high zoom keeps its apparent width (`Kernel/fthrattr.cpp`, `CreateSilhouetteBitmap`, "FeatherScaleFactor"; facts only). Ours visibly narrows past the ceiling.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Above the ceiling the effect region is rendered at 1/k resolution (k = requested radius / 100), blurred at ≤ 100 px, and resampled to device space.
- The `effect_feather_ceiling` golden is re-blessed with a justification; a zoom sweep shows the fade width proportional to zoom across the ceiling.
- Exactness under repaint still holds (render.md invariant 23).

## Notes
Clamp policy and the current limitation: `docs/memory/render.md`, TODO 26.
