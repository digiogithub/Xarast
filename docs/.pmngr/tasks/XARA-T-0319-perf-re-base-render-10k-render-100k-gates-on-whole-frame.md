## Description
Found in XARA-T-0314: since the scene diff (XARA-T-0221), plain `xarast-cli bench render` no longer rasterises after the first frame; the render thread finds no damage and reuses every pixel (~0.4–2 ms). The `render-10k` and `render-100k` gates in `xtask/perf-budgets.txt` were calibrated that way, so they no longer guard rasterisation cost. With `--whole`, 10k measures 12–15 ms locally.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `render-10k` / `render-100k` measure whole-frame rasterisation (`--whole`) with re-derived limits (documented margin), or are split into a "reuse" gate and a "rasterise" gate.
- perf.md updated; the old baseline numbers marked as reuse-path measurements.
