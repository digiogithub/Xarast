## Description
The CPU silhouette pass composites a nested effect's colour result with its alpha, so a feather wrapping a shadow controller sees the half-transparent shadow in its silhouette and its erosion removes most of it (`effect_shadow_feathered` golden). Decide what the original's silhouette of a shadow is (the shadow node is a bitmap-transparency path) and make the silhouette pass follow it. Also covers inner shadows (C5): the model has no `Inner` kind and `.xar` has no inner shadow.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A documented rule for nested effects in silhouette passes, with a golden.

## Notes
No corpus file puts a feather on or around a shadow controller.
