# packaging

Memory note for the **packaging** subsystem (Linux AppImage first; Windows and
macOS in phase 14). Specification in
[`../phases/phase-00-foundations.md`](../phases/phase-00-foundations.md) §W0.4.

## Current state

- `packaging/linux/build-appimage.sh` produces a working AppImage.
- First real build (phase 0): 3.9 MB. **Re-measured 2026-09-23 with the full
  phase 5 stack** (wgpu, egui, winit, AccessKit, zbus portals, clipboard,
  fonts), built exactly as CI does in `ubuntu:22.04`, x86_64: see the size
  table below. It still bundles **no libraries at all**; the binary's only
  `DT_NEEDED` entries are `libgcc_s.so.1`, `libm.so.6`, `libc.so.6` and the
  loader, and its highest glibc symbol is `GLIBC_2.35`.
- `packaging/linux/smoke-test.sh` boots a built image in a bare container
  (no display, no FUSE) and is run by the `distro-smoke` CI job.
- `cargo xtask icons` rasterises `assets/icons/xarast.svg` into the
  freedesktop theme sizes; CI fails if the committed PNGs are stale.
- CI builds x86_64 and aarch64, smoke-tests both, and attaches them to
  releases with zsync metadata.

## Size (2026-09-23, x86_64, commit 8646a5d)

| Item | Bytes | Note |
|---|---:|---|
| **AppImage** | **8 047 096 (7.7 MiB)** | budget 80 MiB (phase 5); gate now 80 in the script and CI |
| static runtime | 944 632 | `--appimage-offset` |
| squashfs payload | 7 101 282 | zstd, 128 KiB blocks |
| `usr/bin/xarast` in the AppDir | 17 999 033 | stripped by linuxdeploy |
| `target/release/xarast` | 21 867 128 | not stripped (release profile has no `strip`) |
| `xarast-cli` (not in the image) | 2 857 112 | unstripped |

Section sizes of the stripped binary: `.text` 12.9 MB, `.rodata` 2.4 MB,
`.eh_frame` 1.1 MB, `.rela.dyn` 0.6 MB, `.gcc_except_table` 0.5 MB,
`.data.rel.ro` 0.4 MB. `cargo bloat --crates` (host build, same flags) of the
12.3 MiB `.text`: std 2.3 MiB (generic code gets attributed to it), naga 1.3,
zbus 0.9, wgpu_core 0.8, winit 0.67, egui 0.54, wgpu_hal 0.45, zvariant 0.45,
accesskit_unix 0.38, wayland_client 0.27, vello_cpu 0.26; every `xarast_*`
crate together is under 0.7 MiB. The GPU and desktop-integration stack is the
image; our own code is a rounding error. There is ~10x headroom, so no size
work is warranted now; if it ever is, the cheap levers are naga's unused
front-ends (wgpu features) and zbus (via ashpd/accesskit).

## Distro smoke matrix (W0.4.8), 2026-09-23

Run locally with podman on the image above, `APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1`, plus
a headless `xarast-cli render` of `Designs/amurdove.xar` (CLI built in the
same container, mounted beside the image).

| Distribution | glibc | --version/--help/--selftest | --selftest-window | loader (NEEDED) | CLI render |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Debian 12 | 2.36 | pass | skipped, exit 0 | 3 libs, none missing | pass, 512x765 |
| Fedora 44 | 2.43 | pass | skipped, exit 0 | 3 libs, none missing | pass |
| openSUSE Tumbleweed | 2.44 | pass | skipped, exit 0 | 3 libs, none missing | pass |
| openSUSE Leap 15.6 | 2.38 | pass | skipped, exit 0 | 3 libs, none missing | pass |
| Arch (SteamOS-like) | 2.44 | pass | skipped, exit 0 | 3 libs, none missing | pass |
| *Ubuntu 20.04 (negative control)* | 2.31 | **fails**: `GLIBC_2.32..2.34 not found` | — | — | — |

Leap 15.6 ships glibc 2.38. Earlier Leap 15.x releases are believed to ship
2.31 (not measured here), which would *not* start the image; the "openSUSE
15.5+" line in phase 0's baseline rationale should be read as "Leap 15.6+".

No compositor or GPU library (`libwayland*`, `libxkbcommon`, `libX11`,
`libxcb`, `libvulkan`, `libGL`, `libEGL`) is linked: all are `dlopen`'d.
On the live host session (Wayland, NVIDIA RTX 4000 Ada, Vulkan) the same image
passed `--selftest-window` (cold start 395 ms) and `--screenshot` of
`amurdove.xar` wrote a 974x1366 PNG and exited on its own.

## Decisions taken (and why)

1. **`linuxdeploy` + `linuxdeploy-plugin-appimage`.** MIT, a single static
   binary, and — crucially — we assemble the AppDir ourselves, so we know
   exactly what ships. `cargo-appimage` gives less control and is
   under-maintained; `appimage-builder` bundles aggressively by default,
   including exactly the libraries that must *not* be bundled.
2. **Bundle nothing that talks to the kernel, the GPU or the compositor.**
   `--exclude-library` covers libGL, libEGL, libgbm, libdrm, libvulkan,
   libwayland-*, libX11/libxcb, libxkbcommon, fontconfig, freetype, libstdc++
   and libgcc_s. A bundled Mesa will not match the host driver and a bundled
   Wayland client will not match the host compositor. This list is the most
   important part of the packaging.
3. **Build inside an explicit `ubuntu:22.04` container, not on the runner.**
   This is not caution, it is a measured requirement: the binary built on this
   development host requires **`GLIBC_2.39`**, which would fail to start on
   Debian 12, Ubuntu 22.04, RHEL 9 or SteamOS. The container pins the baseline
   at glibc **2.35**, and keeps it pinned when GitHub rotates runner images.
4. **Never link musl.** It breaks `dlopen` of the system GL and Vulkan drivers,
   which is the one thing an AppImage must not break.
5. **`APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1` everywhere**, local and CI alike, so the two
   paths are the same path. Containers have no FUSE.
6. **`RUSTFLAGS=-C target-cpu=x86-64-v2` on x86_64 only.** SSE4.2 and POPCNT
   have been safe since 2009 and are worth real throughput in the rasteriser.
   aarch64 keeps the default target CPU.
7. **`panic = "unwind"`, not `abort`.** `cargo-fuzz` needs to catch a panic as
   a finding rather than losing the process, and the `.xar` importer is fuzzed
   from day one.
8. **Metadata validators run on `ubuntu-24.04`, not in the build container.**
   `ubuntu:22.04` ships desktop-file-validate 0.26, which rejects the
   entry's `Version=1.5`, and appstreamcli 0.15, which has no `--strict`.
   The `metadata` job runs `desktop-file-validate` and
   `appstreamcli validate --no-net --strict --explain`. `--no-net` so a
   flaky homepage cannot fail a build. The only remaining finding is the
   pedantic hint `cid-contains-uppercase-letter` for `es.digio.Xarast`; it
   is informational and renaming a published component id is not free, so
   it stays.
9. **The distro smoke job is x86_64-only.** `archlinux` has no aarch64
   image and the goal is loader/glibc coverage, which the architecture does
   not change. Each container is capped with `timeout 300`, the job with
   `timeout-minutes: 10`.

## Invariants that must not be broken

1. The Wayland/X11 `app_id`, the desktop entry basename and its
   `StartupWMClass` are all `xarast`. A test in `xarast-shell` enforces it;
   breaking it gives a generic icon and mis-grouped windows, which is invisible
   until someone installs the package.
2. The AppImage must start on glibc 2.35. Verify with `objdump -T` in CI, not
   by hope.
3. No library from the exclusion list may appear in `usr/lib` of the AppDir.
4. Committed icon PNGs must be reproducible from the SVG by `cargo xtask icons`.
5. The binary's `DT_NEEDED` set is libc, libm, libgcc_s and the loader, and
   nothing else. `smoke-test.sh` fails if a compositor or GPU library shows
   up in the loader's list.
6. `--selftest-window` with neither `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` nor `DISPLAY` prints
   `selftest-window: skipped (...)` and exits 0. The smoke job depends on it.

## Dead ends (do not retry)

- Building the release AppImage on the GitHub runner image directly: produces a
  GLIBC_2.39 binary. Measured, not theoretical.
- Relying on FUSE being present anywhere in CI.
- **Running AppImages on a host with AppImageLauncher.** It registers a
  `binfmt_misc` handler (`/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/appimage-type2`, magic
  `AI\x02` at offset 8) whose interpreter is `/usr/bin/AppImageLauncher`.
  `binfmt_misc` is kernel-global, so inside a podman/docker container every
  AppImage (linuxdeploy included) fails with `No such file or directory`,
  exit 127; on the host, running one *moves it into `/apps`*. Work around it
  locally by zeroing bytes 8..10 of a copy
  (`printf '\0\0\0' | dd of=COPY bs=1 seek=8 count=3 conv=notrunc`); the
  type 2 runtime does not check its own magic. GitHub runners have no such
  handler, so CI needs nothing.

## Runtime dependencies the shell introduces (phase 5)

Added by `xarast-shell`, and all of them affect what the AppImage may and
may not bundle. Nothing here changes the exclusion list; it explains why
two more entries belong under it.

| Dependency | Reached how | Packaging consequence |
|---|---|---|
| `libwayland-client` | `winit` with `wayland-dlopen` | **Never bundled**, already excluded. The `dlopen` feature is what lets the binary start on a host with no Wayland library at all, which is why it is not optional. `octotablet 0.1.0` has no equivalent and was rejected partly for that. |
| `libxkbcommon`, `libX11`/`libxcb` | `winit` X11 backend | Already excluded. |
| XDG portals over D-Bus | `rfd` (`xdg-portal` only) and `ashpd` | No library to bundle: it is a D-Bus call. The `gtk3` and `wayland` backends of `rfd` are **off**, so no C toolkit and no non-`dlopen` Wayland client enters the image. A machine with no session bus is handled: every request answers with a reason. |
| `wl-clipboard-rs` / X11 clipboard | `arboard` with `wayland-data-control` | Pure Rust plus the already-excluded system libraries. |
| Mesa / Vulkan ICDs | `wgpu` | Already excluded, and must stay so. |

The size with all of these linked in is recorded under **Size** above.

## Open TODOs

- [x] Distro smoke matrix (W0.4.8): done locally and wired into CI as
      `distro-smoke` (2026-09-23).
- [x] AppStream validation in CI (`metadata` job).
- [ ] `xarast-cli` is not in the image, so CI's smoke job cannot do a
      headless render (and has no corpus file to render anyway). Tracked as
      XARA-T-0049.
- [ ] GPG signing of the image and the zsync file (phase 12).
- [x] Re-measure the size budget with the phase 5 stack: 7.7 MiB (above).
